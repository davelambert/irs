** VME subtyping

Xia says that the VRML import operation generates a surface VME.  This
means we cannae do iso surface extraction.  but the *typing* info on
those operations doesn't tell use that.  We need extra asssertions
about the instances, and I don't know how we can get that in general.
Can we have a service that asks of a URL ‘what kind of VME is this?’?.

This is a case of the open/closed world assumption.  VMEs are
unclassified.  So do we assume they are by default able to do
anything, and then later remove inferences, or start from a base where
they are useless until proven otherwise?

** Ports

Marco says that all user-facing comms should go through 80 and 443,
because these are the ones the users' firewalls permit.

Check HTTPS operation.

** SAML

Can we use SAML, particularly the Apache implementation (I guess we
can, by proxying Hunchentoot through Apache).

** RDF/OWL interop

We would be able to do some cool stuff with this once their metadata
is in OWL.
