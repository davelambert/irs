;;; The "secrets" file is just that: secret.  We don't distibute it
;;; with the IRS because it contains secret stuff (like passwords,
;;; keys, etc).  OCML will warn that it can't find the file, and lots
;;; of things won't work.  But the things that don't actually depend
;;; on the secrets should still function.
