Description of Changes to 
Version 1 of of AKT Reference Ontology

Enrico Motta, September 8, 2002



In this document I discuss the changes made to the AKT reference ontology (v1 -> v2) in terms of the list of change requests agreed at the meeting in southampton on 24-5-02 and circulated by Nick Gibbins. Items from the minutes are in blue/italics, my comments follow in black/plain text.



GOAL:       recast document issue typology as D3E issue typology

ACTION:     Nick Gibbins to contact sbs re: D3E email notification

Not my action point.


RESOLUTION: section 1.1
            add slot has-telephone-number to PERSON

Actually people are not the only ones with the telephone numbers, also organizations and organization-units can have them.  So, I added slot HAS-TELEPHONE-NUMBER to both LEGAL-AGENT and ORGANIZATION-UNIT

RESOLUTION: section 1.2
            add slot has-fax-number to PERSON

Added to LEGAL-AGENT and ORGANIZATION-UNIT - same rationale as for 1.1.


RESOLUTION: section 1.3
            add slot has-academic-degree (range ACADEMIC-DEGREE) to PERSON

Done!


RESOLUTION: section 1.4
            add slot to THING

Done. THING has now a slot called HAS-PRETTY-NAME

RESOLUTION: section 1.5
            add slot to THING

Done. THING has now a slot called HAS-VARIANT-NAME


RESOLUTION: section 1.6
            add slot family-name to PERSON
            add slot given-name to PERSON

Done.

(def-class PERSON (legal-agent tangible-thing)
  ((full-name :type string)
   (family-name :type string)
   (given-name :type string)
   (has-gender :type gender)
   (has-academic-degree :type academic-degree)
   (has-appellation :type appellation))
  :slot-renaming ((full-name has-pretty-name)
                  ))

Note that full-name the more generic HAS-PRETTY-NAME inherited from THING.  I cannot see situations where both may be needed - EM


RESOLUTION: section 1.7
            raises some interesting cultural issues (eg. Italy does
            not make the distinction between towns and villages)
            
            add class TOWN as subclass of MUNICIPAL-UNIT

DONE.


RESOLUTION: section 2.1
            add rationale defining ORGANIZATION-SIZE
            ACTION on OU

DONE.  John Domingue provided info about guidelines used by EU to determine whether an organization is micro, small, or medium. Dividing line between large and very large fixed at 10000 employees.

RESOLUTION: section 2.2
            no change
             - not important if slots are unused
- not promiscuous/not minimal

No change done to GEOPOLITICAL-ENTITY.  However, rationale has been clarified - see definition below

(def-class GEOPOLITICAL-ENTITY (Geographical-Region Generic-Agent)
  "A geopolitical entity is a geographical area which is associated with some
   sort of political structure. For instance, Russia, Italy, 
   The-city-of-Messina, etc..
   A geopolitical entity can be also seen as an agent - e.g., France declared 
   war to Spain")


RESOLUTION: section 2.3
            change documentation for LOCATION and GEOGRAPHICAL-REGION
             - LOCATIONs can be real or fantastic (ie. imaginary)
             - GEOGRAPHIC-REGIONS are always real

LOCATION is now a TANGIBLE-THING
No change needed to GEOGRAPHICAL-REGION.  Current version of the ontology does not distinguish between real or imaginary animals/persons/locations/etc..I suggest we introduce this distinction in later versions, if really needed

RESOLUTION: section 2.3
            make GEOPOLITICAL-ENTITY a subclass of TANGIBLE-THING
            make GEOPOLITICAL-ENTITY a subclass of GEOGRAPHICAL-REGION
            rationale to be clarified and checked against HPKB


As said above, I did not need to change the definition of GEOPOLITICAL-ENTITY, simply to clarify the rationale
ACTION:     Enrico Motta to investigate issue of intangible geopolitical
            entities (NATO raised as a possible example in the meeting)

The problem with the NATO example is that NATO is both a POLITICAL-ORGANIZATION and a GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY. The latter is a TANGIBLE-THING. The ontology does not specify whether an organization is a tangible or intangible thing, although it should probably be the latter. This means that NATO is one of those examples where something has both a tangible and an intangible connotation, depending whether we look at it as a geopolitical-entity or as an organization.  Because the current ontology does not say anything about the tangibility of organizations, it is OK for the time being to say that NATO is both a POLITICAL-ORGANIZATION and a GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY. 

(def-instance NATO political-organization
  "nato is both a political organization and a geopolitical entity")

(def-instance NATO geopolitical-entity
  "nato is both a political organization and a geopolitical entity"))

 However this issue may require more work (another solution could be to distinguish NATO the GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY from NATO-ORGANIZATION the POLITICAL-ORGANIZATION, or we could follow cyc and have things that are both tangible and intangible, etc...).

RESOLUTION: section 2.4
            no change
- duplicate of 2.3

No action required

RESOLUTION: section 2.5
            change PERIODICAL-PUBLICATION to SERIAL-PUBLICATION
change cardinality of has-periodicity slot on
            SERIAL-PUBLICATION to max-cardinality 1

I have introduced class SERIAL-PUBLICATION but retained PERIODICAL-PUBLICATION as its subclass. Hope this is OK.

I have also introduced the notion of COMPOSITE-PUBLICATION, so that we can talk about things which contain a number of publications, e.g., edited books, journals, magazines, newspapers, etc..


(def-class COMPOSITE-PUBLICATION (publication)
  "A publication which contains items which cane be themselves referenced through a 
   publication reference.  Composite publications include newspapers, magazines and journals.
   A book which is a collection of articles is a composite publication, a monograph is not"
  ((contains-publication :min-cardinality 1
                         :type publication)
   ))

For instance, a newspaper is now defined as follows:

(def-class NEWSPAPER (periodical-publication composite-publication)
  ((contains-news-item :type news-item))
  :slot-renaming ((contains-news-item contains-publication)
                  ))

Note that I have also introduced the notion of NEWS-ITEM.  

(def-class NEWS-ITEM (article-in-a-composite-publication))

This is a subclass of ARTICLE-IN-A-COMPOSITE-PUBLICATION

(def-class ARTICLE-IN-A-COMPOSITE-PUBLICATION (publication)
  ((included-in-publication :type composite-publication)))

RESOLUTION: section 2.6
            clarify difference between PUBLICATION and
            PUBLICATION-REFERENCE in rationale, no other changes

PUBLICATION-REFERENCE is now ABSTRACT-INFORMATION (an intangible thing)
PUBLICATION is a INFORMATION-BEARING-OBJECT  (a tangible thing)

PUBLICATION now contains a new slot, CITES-PUBLICATION-REFERENCE. This was requested by SBS to handle citations.

RESOLUTION: section 2.7
            all TANGIBLE need to be TEMPORAL

Done.


RESOLUTION: section 2.8
            no change
             - PUBLISHING-HOUSEs could be both PROFIT-ORGANIZATIONs and
               NON-PROFIT-ORGANIZATIONs
             - LEARNING-CENTERED-ORGANIZATIONs could be both
               PROFIT-ORGANIZATIONs and NON-PROFIT-ORGANIZATIONs
             - can't rely on having 'nice' hierarchy

No action required

RESOLUTION: section 2.9
            add extra values of WORK-STATUS and elaborate

Class EMPLOYEE has now a new slot called HAS-CONTRACT-TYPE.  The type is EMPLOYMENT-CONTRACT-TYPE, which can be PERMANENT-CONTRACT or TEMPORARY-CONTRACT.


RESOLUTION: section 3.1
            remove second definition of CALENDAR-DATE

Done


            create a common superclass of CALENDAR-DATE and
            TIME-ENTITY (coarse-grained time entity?)

            break inheritance between CALENDAR-DATE and TIME-ENTITY

ONGOING:    section 3.2
            time interval/time point distinction is important
            use fix from other ontology?

ACTION:     Enrico Motta to propose solution to time interval/time point
            Issue

This required quite a bit of work..The solution I have adopted is based on the time ontology used in the SUO effort. There is now a common superclass called TIME-POSITION.  This describes a position on the time axis, either a TIME-INTERVAL or a TIME-POINT.  As in the previous version of the ontology CALENDAR-DATE is still a subclass of TIME-POINT. However, the definition now explicitly states that a calendar date must have a day, a month and a year, but cannot have second, minute or hour.

(def-class CALENDAR-DATE (time-point)
 "A calendar date is a time point in which month, day and year have 
  been specified but hour, minute and second have not"
  ((minute-of :type minute-in-time :max-cardinality 0 )
   (second-of :type second-in-time :max-cardinality 0 )
   (hour-of :type hour-in-time :max-cardinality 0 )
   (day-of :type day-in-time :cardinality 1)
   (month-of :type month-in-time :cardinality 1)
   (year-of :type year-in-time :cardinality 1)))


The new definition of TIME-INTERVAL is as follows:

(def-class TIME-INTERVAL (time-position)
  "An interval is defined by two time points or a duration.  
   Classes of intervals, e.g., a day, can be defined by specifying only
   a duration.  A time interval has no gaps"

  ((begins-at-time-point :type time-point :max-cardinality 1)
   (ends-at-time-point :type time-point :max-cardinality 1)
   (has-duration :type duration :max-cardinality 1)))

Note that it now satisfies Austin's request of having begin/end, rather than start/end. 

A new quantity, DURATION, has also been introduced to correctly characterise a TIME-INTERVAL in terms of begin-point, end-point and duration. DURATION is defined as a PHYSICAL-QUANTITY, a new subclass of QUANTITY. NUMBER has been also redefined as a subclass of QUANTITY. The slots has-unit-of-measure and has-magnitude are therefore now associated with PHYSICAL-QUANTITY, rather than with QUANTITY.


Another change: SECOND is now a REAL-NUMBER, as requested by Austin.  

Note that a TIME-POSITION is relative to a TIMEZONE - again something Austin requested.

(def-class TIME-POSITION (intangible-thing)
  "A time position is either a time interval or a time point.
   Any time position is relative to a time zone"
  ((in-timezone :default-value "+00:00" :type timezone)))

(def-class TIMEZONE (string)
  "We represent a time zone as a string with the format 
   {-/+}hh:mm ")




RESOLUTION: section 3.3
            change local range of has-author on TECHNOLOGY to
            GENERIC-AGENT

RESOLUTION: section 3.4
            change local range of owned-by on TECHNOLOGY to
            LEGAL-AGENT (not to GENERIC-AGENT, as in Soton document)

Done

RESOLUTION: section 3.5
            replace slot meeting-attendees on class
            MEETING-TAKING-PLACE with slot meeting-attendee with
            multiple cardinality

Done

ONGOING:    section 3.6
            against first proposal (address as string) as sole solution
            (although this could be combined with the second proposal
- first proposal is effectively an address label)

New definition of POSTAL-ADDRESS allows both structured specifications and/or simply specifying an address as a string, slot ADDRESS-PRETTY-LABEL.  This renames the generic HAS-PRETTY-NAME, inherited from THING

(def-class POSTAL-ADDRESS (address)
  "Modified to allow addresses to be given as strings, with no structure"
 ((address-street :type string)
   (address-area :type local-district)
   (address-number :type integer)
   (address-building :type string)
   (address-city-or-village :type municipal-unit)
   (address-postcode :type string)
   (address-region :type geographical-region)
   (address-country :type country)
   (address-pretty-label :type string))
 :slot-renaming ((address-pretty-label has-pretty-name )))


ACTION:     Nick Gibbins to elaborate second proposal in section 3.6

Not my action.

ONGOING:    section 3.7
            not acceptable to have appellation as a string
            needs further work

EM refuses to spend his time worrying about appellations!!!!


ACTION:     Kieron O'Hara to propose solution to section 3.7
             - an ontology of appellations
             - there exists a fixed ordering for any given combination
               of appellations

Not my action.

RESOLUTION: section 4.1 (related to section 2.6)
            (see also comments from Stuart Aitken)

            proposal to include extra top level classes from cyc
            (COMPOSITE-TANGIBLE-AND-INTANGIBLE, PARTIALLY-TANGIBLE) is
            not acceptable

            proposal from yk (discard tangible/intangible distinction
            and use only THING) is not acceptable

            create class INFORMATION-BEARING-THING as subclass of
            THING, bearing the slots currently on
            INFORMATION-BEARING-OBJECT 

            make INFORMATION-BEARING-OBJECT a subclass of
            INFORMATION-BEARING-THING and TANGIBLE-THING

            make ABSTRACT-INFORMATION a subclass of
            INFORMATION-BEARING-THING and INTANGIBLE-THING

No action on the above points. Not clear why we need INFORMATION-BEARING-THING and in any case ABSTRACT-INFORMATION is not an INFORMATION-BEARING-THING! It is the thing being born!

            make PUBLICATION-REFERENCE a subclass of ABSTRACT-INFORMATION

Done

RESOLUTION: section 4.2
            PUBLICATION-REFERENCE already fixed (section 4.1)

            make LOCATION a subcless of TANGIBLE-THING

Done

            make ADDRESS a subclass of ABSTRACT-INFORMATION

Done

            change rationale of INTANGIBLE-THING to 'things made of
            matter, real or fantastic'

Done

RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - repeated inheritance (global properties)
            redefine has-research-interest as a global property

RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - repeated inheritance (RESEARCHER under
            WORKING-PERSON and EMPLOYEE) 

            make RESEARCHER a direct subclass of PERSON

Not sure why we want to do this.  Are we talking about unemployed researchers or members of the aristocracy?

            add class CORPORATE-RESEARCHER

Again, not clear why we need this.  Not Done


ONGOING:    section 4.3 - misused inheritance (roles vs subclasses)

ACTION:     Nick Gibbins to produce proposal for representing person
            Roles

Not my action


RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - student vs affiliated-person
            no change
- students must be affiliated

No change

RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - affiliation to ORGANIZATION-UNIT for
            AFFILIATED-PERSON 

            add slot has-affiliation-to-unit (range ORGANIZATION-UNIT) on
            AFFILIATED-PERSON

            EMPLOYEE:
            works-for is a renaming of has-affiliation
            works-in-unit is a renaming of has-affiliation-to-unit

            STUDENT:
            slot studies-at is a renaming of has-affiliation

            add slot studies-in-unit as a renaming of
            has-affiliation-to-unit 

Done

RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - obscure inheritance (bullet 1)
            no change
- duplicate of section 4.3 (roles vs subclasses)

No change

RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - name resolution (bullet 2)
            add restrictions to (renamed) affiliation relations on
            subclasses

            i.e. studies-at has range EDUCATIONAL-ORGANIZATION

Done


RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - visiting researchers (bullet 3)
            model visiting researchers as instances of both
            AFFILIATED-PERSON and EMPLOYEE

            (another example of roles vs subclasses)

VISITING-RESEARCHER introduced as a subclass of both researcher and affiliated-person. The organization and organization-unit being visited should be specified. Rules (axioms) infer new affiliation from organization and organization unit being visited

(def-class VISITING-RESEARCHER (researcher affiliated-person)
  ((organization-being-visited :type organization)
   (organization-unit-being-visited :type organization-unit)
   (person-being-visited :type employee)))

(def-rule VISITING-RESEARCHER-GETS-AFFILIATION-TO-VISITED-ORGANIZATION
  ((has-affiliation ?x ?y)
   if
   (visiting-researcher ?x)
   (organization-being-visited ?x ?y)))

(def-rule VISITING-RESEARCHER-GETS-AFFILIATION-TO-VISITED-ORGANIZATION-UNIT
  ((has-affiliation-to-unit ?x ?y)
   if
   (visiting-researcher ?x)
   (organization-unit-being-visited ?x ?y)))



RESOLUTION: section 4.3 - (bullet 4)
            no change
- duplicate of repeated inheritance

no action



RESOLUTION: section 5 - rationale

            (em) rationale is difficult - should be distributed
            activity

            change management tool should be used to manage rationale
            as well (part of ontology)


RESOLUTION: section 5, paragraph 2 (ORGANIZATION-SIZE)
            no change
             - duplicate of section 2.1

RESOLUTION: section 5, paragraph 3 (PUBLICATION vs PUBLICATION-REFERENCE)
            no change
             - duplicate of section 2.6

RESOLUTION: section 6 - tool support
            no change
             - specific tool limitations not an issue for the ontology
- use better tools, says enrico

The above issues are either "no action", or generic issues about tools. 


ACTION:     John Domingue to extend ontology to cover news items

I have introduced the notion of news-item. More work needed to extend it for marking up stories.
