* Getting IRS

Use Git to get a copy of the IRS source.

    git clone http://github.com/kmi/irs.git

This will produce a directory called ‘irs’.

* Getting external dependencies

The IRS depends on several ASDF-based Lisp libraries.  The easiest way
to get these is probably clbuild
<http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/>.

The IRS also depends on the OCML reasoner, and due to the tight
dependency between them, we use Git's submodule functionality to get
OCML and keep it in sync.  On a fresh IRS install, you should run:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

* Load, build and run the IRS

On Linux: You first need to run ‘make linux’, which will create some
scaled graphics (Lispworks 5 on Linux doesn't seem to scale them
properly itself, so we do so it ourselves).

Run a Lisp (Lispworks 6 is recommended, SBCL works sometimes).  You
need to load the file scripts/irs.lisp:

    CL-USER> (load "scripts/irs.lisp")

Once you have loaded irs.lisp, you need to build IRS and run it:

    CL-USER> (require :irs)
    CL-USER> (irs:start)

You should now be able to see something intersting at
http://localhost:8080/irs.

* Testing

There are some tests for the IRS, which can be run from the make file:

    $ make check

or by loading scripts/run-tests.lisp from Lispworks.
