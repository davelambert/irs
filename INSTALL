* Getting IRS

Use Git to get a copy of the IRS source:

    $ git clone http://github.com/kmi/irs.git

This will produce a directory called ‘irs’.

* Getting external dependencies

The IRS depends on several ASDF-based Lisp libraries.  The first is
the OCML reasoner, and due to the tight coupling between them, we use
Git's submodule functionality to get OCML and keep it in sync.  On a
fresh IRS install, you should run:

    $ cd irs
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Following subsequent Git operations that affect the state of
external/ocml, you should run:

    $ git submodule update

In addition, we need several libraries from the wider Common Lisp
ecosystem.  You can install these any way you choose, but the easiest
is to use Zach Beane's Quicklisp (currently in beta, so be careful).
You can install Quicklisp and download all the necessary libraries by
running:

    $ make install-quicklisp

* Load, build and run the IRS

If you are using Lispworks 5 on Linux you first need to run:

    $ make linux

which will create some scaled graphics for the user interface
(Lispworks 5 on Linux doesn't scale them properly itself, so we do so
it ourselves).

Run a Lisp (Lispworks 6 and SBCL are supported).  You need to load the
file scripts/irs.lisp:

    CL-USER> (load "scripts/irs.lisp")

Once you have loaded irs.lisp, you need to build IRS and run it:

    CL-USER> (require :irs)
    CL-USER> (irs:start)

You should now be able to see something intersting at
http://localhost:8080/irs.

* Testing

There are some tests for the IRS, which can be run from the make file:

    $ make check

or by loading scripts/run-tests.lisp from Lispworks.
